# Meme_Share
It is a simple Android application which loads different memes from Reddit and has the accessibility to share the meme via different social media platforms.

Used Volley Library to fetch JSON data(image url) using GET request method from an URL provided by a public API and Glide Library to load meme image from image url fetched from the JSON data.

You can copy the whole repository and run the application on a emulator or your android device.
If you want to see only the the java code file/ xml file/ resources used then open the files in app->src->main

Thank you!!
